# 🐶🐱 Dog vs. Cat Classification

A deep learning-based image classification model that predicts whether an image contains a dog or a cat. Users can provide an image URL as input, and the model will classify it accordingly.

🚀 Features

🖼️ Accepts an image URL as input
🔍 Uses a deep learning model (CNN) for classification
📊 High accuracy with a pre-trained model
📤 Output will be cat/ dog based on the url

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python – Core programming language
📒 Jupyter Notebook – For writing and executing code
🧠 Deep Learning Framework – TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (Specify the one you used)
📦 Model Architecture – CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) / Pre-trained model (ResNet, VGG, etc.)
🖼️ Image Processing – OpenCV / PIL (if used)
🔢 NumPy & Pandas – Data manipulation and processing
📊 Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization of results

🏗️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cat-vs-Dog-Classification.git
cd Cat-vs-Dog-Classification

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If using Python  

Run the model:
python classify.py  # Modify based on your script 

🎯 Usage

Provide an image URL as input.
The model processes the image.
It outputs "Dog" or "Cat" with a confidence score.
